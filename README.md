This GitHub account was created to fulfil an application requirement of HYF. However, as I grow as a web developer, I hope that this account will also concomittantly grow in both scope and functionality. If you're from HYF and have any questions or comments, please just email me: sampradaha@gmail.com . I'm absolutely new to coding and Github, so I'm going to keep this description short, at least until I feel that I have some meaningful content to add or contribution to make.
