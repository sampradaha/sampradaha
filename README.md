This GitHub account was originally created solely to fulfil an application requirement of HYF. However, I look forward to the growth in scope and functionality of this account as I myself grow as a web developer. If you're from HYF and have any questions, please just email me: sampradaha@gmail.com . I'm absolutely new to coding and Github, so I'm going to keep this description short, at least until I feel that I have some meaningful content to add. 

# Figuring out Github
## complete beginner

I'm supposed to show some understanding of markdown but the youtube tutorials that I've found all seem to assume some knowledge of it
